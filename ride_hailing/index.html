                    App-based ride-hailing services, such as Uber and Lyft, have become popular thanks to technology
                    advancements including smartphones and 4G/5G network. However, little is known about to what degree
                    their operations impact urban traffic since Transportation Network Companies seldom share their ride
                    data due to business and user privacy reasons. Recently, transportation engineering researchers
                    began to collect data in large cities trying to understand the transportation impacts of
                    ride-hailing services, so as to assist transport planning and policy making. However, (1) there does
                    not exist a general data collection approach applicable to any city, and (2) the studies were based
                    on historical data and cannot project the future easily even though ride-hailing services are
                    developing quickly.

                    In this paper, we introduce our approach to building a digital twin of the transportation in the
                    medium-sized city of Birmingham, Alabama. This digital twin is a transportation simulation model
                    that incorporates transportation modes such as public transits and ride-hailing services, in
                    addition to private vehicles that constitute the majority of Birmingham's traffic. With this digital
                    twin, transportation engineers can flexibly analyze the impact of ride-hailing services under
                    different scenarios, such as "if the number of Uber drivers doubles" which could happen in the near
                    future. The digital twin may also enable new opportunities, such as being an environment for
                    learning policies with reinforcement learning.

                    To enable realistic transportation simulation, we propose a novel approach to collect Uber ride data
                    that is easy to carry out in any city. This approach collects app screenshots about Uber rides from
                    Uber drivers, and uses crowdsourcing to postprocess these screenshots to extract detailed ride
                    information. We then fit a spatiotemporal distribution of Uber rides using the collected data via
                    network kernel density estimation (KDE). The existing network KDE method is flawed in that the
                    contributions of different data samples are not the same, so we propose a new formulation to solve
                    this issue. The distribution combined with population statistics from census data enable the
                    generation of realistic Uber rides for agent-based simulation.

                    Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) use online-enabled apps to provide on-demand transportation
                    services. TNCs facilitate travelers to connect with drivers that can offer them rides for
                    compensation using driver-owned vehicles. The ride requests can be for (a) individual or (b) shared
                    rides. The latter, also known as ride-pooling services, accommodates requests of unrelated parties
                    with origins and destinations along the same route who agree to share the same vehicle, usually at a
                    discounted fare. Uber and Lyft offer ride-pooling services in select markets. Compared to individual
                    ride requests, ride-pooling services hold better promise toward easing urban congestion by reducing
                    the number of automobiles on the road. However, their impact on traffic operations is still not
                    fully understood. Using Birmingham, AL as a case study, this research evaluated the impact that
                    ride-pooling services have on traffic operations using a Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MATSim)
                    model of the Birmingham metro area. Scenarios were developed to simulate baseline conditions (no TNC
                    service) and ride-pooling availability with two types of ride-pooling services, namely door-to-door
                    (d2d) and stop-based (sB) service and three fleet sizes (200, 400, and 800 vehicles). The results
                    indicate that when TNC vehicles are added to the network, the Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT)
                    decrease by up to 5.78% for the door-to-door (d2d) service, and up to 2.71% for stop-based (sB)
                    services, as compared to the baseline scenario (no TNC service). The findings also suggest that an
                    increase in the size of the ride-pooling fleet results in a rise in total ride-pooling service VKT,
                    network-wide total VKT, and detour distance. However, increasing the size of the ride-pooling fleet
                    also results in a decrease in the ride request rejection rates, thus benefiting the customers and
                    decreasing the vehicle empty ratio which, in turn, benefits the TNC drivers. The results further
                    suggest that a fleet of 200 ride-pooling vehicles can meet the current demand for service in the
                    Birmingham region at all times, thus it is the optimal ride-pooling TNC fleet size for a
                    medium-sized city such as Birmingham.

                    In the recent years, TNCs (transportation network companies) and on-demand ridesharing services have
                    grown rapidly. Given conflicting reports on TNC impacts, a need exists to study mode choice shifts
                    in the presence of TNC services and their effects on urban congestion. Using Birmingham, AL
                    (Alabama) as a case study, this paper showcases the feasibility of modeling TNC services using the
                    MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) platform, and evaluating the impact of such services on
                    traffic operations. Data used for the study were gathered from Uber drivers and riders through
                    surveys, as well as the US Census. The results indicate that when 200, 400, and 800 TNC vehicles are
                    added to the network, the VKT (vehicle kilometers traveled) increase by 22%, 23.6%, and 23.2%,
                    respectively, compared to the baseline scenario (no TNC service). Analysis of hourly average speeds,
                    hourly average travel times, and hourly volumes along study corridors further indicate that TNC
                    services increase traffic congestion, in particular, during the AM/PM peak periods. Moreover, the
                    study shows that the optimal TNC fleet size for the Birmingham region is 400 to 500 active TNC
                    vehicles per day. Such fleet size minimizes idle time and the number of TNC vehicles hovering, which
                    have adverse impacts on TNC drivers, and the environment while ensuring TNC service availability and
                    reasonable waiting times for TNC customers.
