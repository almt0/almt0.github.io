        <h2>Realistic Transport Simulation: Tackling the Small Data Challenge with Open Data</h2>
        <p>MATSim is the state-of-the-art open source software for agent-based transport simulation, intended for use to evaluate transportation planning models. A standard approach to use MATSim is to conduct a user survey about their day-plans of travel, from which a synthetic dataset of agentsâ€™ day-plans for an entire region is generated for transport simulation. The simulation output can be used for various evaluations, such as congestion conditions of road segments and their peak hours. This paper aims to conduct a transportation simulation on MATSim for the region of Birmingham, AL. A traditional approach based on Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) is not sufficient for generating a realistic synthetic population due to the small data problem: Birmingham is a small city with limited transport data statistics, and we only have a survey of 451 people for their day-plans. To tackle the small data problem, we seek the assistance of abundant open data such as US Census data, OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses and Birmingham Business Alliance to complete the fine details realistically. We also utilize various data science and machine learning techniques to build models that utilize these open data to generate a realistic population. Preliminary tests demonstrate reasonable accuracy of the simulation results.</p>
