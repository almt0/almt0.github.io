                <p class="justify-text">MATSim is the state-of-the-art open source software for agent-based transport
                    simulation, intended for use to evaluate transportation planning models. A standard approach to use
                    MATSim is to conduct a user survey about their day-plans of travel, from which a synthetic dataset
                    of agentsâ€™ day-plans for an entire region is generated for transport simulation. The simulation
                    output can be used for various evaluations, such as congestion conditions of road segments and their
                    peak hours. This paper aims to conduct a transportation simulation on MATSim for the region of
                    Birmingham, AL. A traditional approach based on Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) is not
                    sufficient for generating a realistic synthetic population due to the small data problem: Birmingham
                    is a small city with limited transport data statistics, and we only have a survey of 451 people for
                    their day-plans. To tackle the small data problem, we seek the assistance of abundant open data such
                    as US Census data, OpenStreetMap, OpenAddresses and Birmingham Business Alliance to complete the
                    fine details realistically. We also utilize various data science and machine learning techniques to
                    build models that utilize these open data to generate a realistic population. Preliminary tests
                    demonstrate reasonable accuracy of the simulation results. </p>

                <p class="justify-text">
                    At the beginning of the twentieth century, the United States was leading in the public transit
                    sector, but following World War II, private automobiles became more affordable and gained
                    popularity. Transportation infrastructure investments that increased road capacity further
                    facilitated the increase in automobile use at the expense of reduced public transit ridership. With
                    the increase of dependency on automobiles and the continuing growth of private automobile ownership
                    and use, various problems became major challenges in big cities of USA. These include traffic
                    congestion, air pollution, road and parking infrastructure costs, energy consumption, traffic
                    safety, fewer mobility options for the non-drivers, and a decline in the image and use of public
                    transit. This study uses a medium sized city, Birmingham as a case study to investigate the
                    potential of public transit to reduce automobile trips and in turn improve the overall performance
                    of the road network by addressing the abovementioned challenges. An agent-based simulation model was
                    developed for the Birmingham metropolitan region using the Multi-agent Transport Simulation (MATSim)
                    platform. Three scenarios were considered with gradually increased transit ridership to identify the
                    benefits of increased public transit. Traffic volume, network average speed, and travel times were
                    used as performance measures for the evaluation of the designated scenarios. Results suggest that
                    modal shifts toward public transit and reduction in travel demand for an automobile can result in
                    improvements in speed and travel time for all users. Therefore, investments for improving transit
                    quality and frequency of service, as well as campaigns to improve the image of public transit and
                    make it a mode of choice for transportation users can increase transit ridership and, in turn,
                    improve network operations, thus are deemed worthy for medium sized cities.
