                <p class="justify-text">Micromobility refers to small, lightweight vehicles
                    such as shared bicycles and electric scooters (e-scooters). Recently,
                    shared micromobility services see increasing deployment in urban
                    areas to solve the “last mile problem, where the travel distance is
                    considered long when walking on foot, but not worth driving a car
                    (e.g., to avoid parking). A key question to ask when deciding
                    whether to deploy a shared micromobility service in an area is:
                    how much car traffic can be reduced during peak hours if this
                    service is deployed? This work answers this question by agent
                    based transportation simulation. The key challenge here is to
                    generate a realistic synthetic population of the target area along
                    with their travel day-plans. </p>

                    Micromobility is an innovative transportation strategy that has demonstrated a great potential for
                    congestion mitigation. However, the research on micromobility is very limited in the field of
                    transportation. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive study to analyze, quantify, and
                    understand the impacts of micromobility on congestion reduction and recommend corresponding
                    intervention strategies for stakeholders. We firstly inferred origins and destinations of e-scooter
                    trips in Washington, D.C. based on the General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) data and modeled
                    the trip origin demand of e-scooter services. The Ordinary Linear Squares (OLS), Lasso, Decision
                    Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Boosting models were used to predict the trip origin demand in
                    census block group level. The RF model had the best performance among the five models regarding root
                    mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Then we used feature importance (FI) and
                    partial dependence plots (PDP) to interpret the RF model. The results showed that the most important
                    category of variable was built environment variables. From PDPs, we also observed nonlinear
                    relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables. After that, we developed an
                    extended module for shared micromobility simulation in MATSim by applying modifications to its
                    carsharing module. We also developed an effective pipeline to generate synthetic student plans by
                    using different real data sources. The updated MATSim framework was utilized to generate realistic
                    day plans for travelers in a case study that considered 500, 750 and 1000 e-scooters on and around
                    the UAB campus. The case study results confirmed that the simulated traffic volumes are lower and
                    travel speeds are higher when e-scooters are available, compared to the base case scenario. Then we
                    discussed the policy related to shared micromobility operation and developed a decision-support tool
                    that can collect and analyze the e-scooter-related data. Lastly, we created a new decision-support
                    tool to assist cities to better monitor and analyze e-scooter usage and gather inputs from
                    residents. We also presented policy recommendations on regulatory structure, general terms and
                    conditions, operations oversight, public engagement, data, and infrastructure. This project provided
                    rich insights of key factors associated with micromobility demand, examined the potential impact of
                    deployment of e-scooters and other micromobility options on traffic operations, and generated new
                    knowledge for stakeholders to facilitate planning micromobility policies and practices.
